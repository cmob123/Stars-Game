# Stars-Game

React application which renders a simple math game. You start with 1-9 stars, chosen randomly. To play, select one or more numbers which sum to the number of stars. If you can't, use one of your 5 re-draws. If you use all numbers 1-9, you win! If you are out of redraws and still can't choose numbers which sum to the number of stars on the screen, then you lose. Either way you have the option to restart.
